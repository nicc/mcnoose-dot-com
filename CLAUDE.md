# mcnoose-dot-com

Portfolio site: a bathroom wall. Wallpaper header with framed cross-stitch → bull-nose row → white tile grid (one project per tile) → skirting board. Builds to a single `dist/index.html`.

## Token efficiency
Use tokens efficiently at all times — in this file, in replies, in tool use. Read only what the task needs; don't restate diffs.

## Aesthetics are the product
The vibe is the key outcome, not a finish. Treat look and feel with the same rigour as function:
- Iterate visually: `npm run shots [-- firefox|webkit]` → read `shots/<browser>/*.png` before and after every visual change.
- Communicate in felt terms first (what it's like to look at), then mechanism. Show screenshots.
- Name register conflicts early; don't split the difference.
- Expect many rounds, especially halftone print, wallpaper, skirting, hover effects.

## Constants
- Every tweakable value lives in `src/config.ts` → CSS vars set in `src/scene.ts`. No magic numbers in CSS/TS.
- One `KEY: value,` per line: the dev panel's save rewrites them in place (`tools/config-writer.ts`).
- New keys appear in the panel automatically; add a slider range in `src/dev/panel.ts` `RANGES`.
- Units: px unless named `*_TILES` (× tile size) or `*_RATIO`.

## Layout rules (tested in `src/layout.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/`)
- Tiles square, ≤ `TILE_MAX`; one full tile + `MIN_PEEK` of each neighbour fits both axes (height = svh).
- Column added only if it still leaves `MIN_PEEK` visible each side; grout counted once per joint.
- Edge partial columns always blank; last project row padded with blanks; `TRAILING_ROWS` after; page ends at skirting.
- Bull-nose joints anchored at page centre + `BULLNOSE_OFFSET` — deliberately not centred.

## Projects
`src/projects.json` (ordered `{title, url, logo}`) + logo files in `src/logos/`. Test fails on missing fields/logos.

## Browser support
Chrome, Firefox, Safari on desktop and mobile, always. Check support before using new CSS/JS. `npm run test:e2e` covers chromium/firefox/webkit + Pixel/iPhone emulation; Playwright WebKit ≠ real iOS Safari.

## Commands
`npm run dev` (with tweak panel) · `npm test` · `npm run test:e2e` · `npm run shots` · `npm run build`

## Tracking
Beads (`bd`). `bd ready` at session start; claim, note, close. No git remote — don't push; commit only when asked.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
